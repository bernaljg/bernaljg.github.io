Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Bernal Jim√©nez and I'm a Computer Science & Engineering PhD student at The Ohio State University working with Prof. Yu Su. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing with an emphasis in Information Extraction (IE). I aim to leverage modern NLP methods and curated knowledge resources to build more efficient, interpretable and controllable IE systems which meet the needs of high-impact areas like clinical practice, biomedical research and law.
