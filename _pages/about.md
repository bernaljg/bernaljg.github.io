I'm a fifth year Computer Science PhD student at The Ohio State University. 
I feel very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/) and form part of the wonderful OSU NLP lab.

## Research Interests

My research interests are broadly centered around understanding and developing NLP technologies in knowledge-rich domains, such as biomedicine, science, law, journalism and more. Within these domains, I am passionate about both **translational** research that looks to solve impactful real-world problems as well as more **fundamental** research concerning the exciting new abilities of LLMs.

Over the last few years, my research has mainly focused on leveraging and understanding **language models** (of different 
sizes and pre-trained on different domains) to improve fundamental biomedical NLP tasks like **information extraction** for downstream applications such as organizing scientific literature or detecting dangerous drug-drug interactions. I am beyond excited to continue tackling the growing number of ready-to-solve problems that NLP has unlocked in a vast number of complex and knowledge-rich fields from medicine and science to journalism, governance, education and more.

More fundamentally, I am interested in investigating the interdependence of memorization and reasoning in large and small LMs.  Our intuition suggests that our reasoning abilities can be used regardless of context, well outside domains we have memorized well. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs have similarly disentangled their reasoning capabilities from their more straighforward semantic representation abilities. I believe addressing this question could lead to interesting insights for both improving LLMs for domains in which rich knowledge is required and perhaps even for seeing our own brains a bit differently.

## Short Bio

After growing up in Costa Rica I moved to the US in 2011 to obtain my BA in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley and start my journey in AI. 
I first encountered the wonders of backprop while doing neuroscience research at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). 
After graduation I decided to pursue my passion for solving real-world problems and joined
[Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) 
and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), 
a biomedical NLP startup working to make clinical trial recruitment more effective and efficient. 
At Mendel, I not only developed my technical and research skills but also saw first hand 
what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. 

I left Mendel three years later and started my PhD life at the OSU NLP lab to further develop my research skills. 
Most recently, in the summer of 2022, I completed a research internship in [Dr. Olivier Bodenreider’s](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/BodenreiderOlivier.html) 
lab at the National Library of Medicine working on improving the construction process of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

## Hobbies & Fun Times

In my free time, I like to stay active by going to the gym, dancing, playing soccer, climbing and hiking (preferably to 
and from tall mountains). I also love meeting interesting new people and learning about their lives and research (conferences are my 
happy place). When I am not moving around or socializing I like fun escapist content such as fantasy, 
sci-fi and even some magical realism every once in a while.

Please send me an email or message me on Twitter if you wanna chat. Always down to meet new people!
