Hi! I am a Computer Science PhD student at The Ohio State University working with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). My research is broadly related to natural language processing and machine learning and more specifically focuses on exploring **foundation models** and how they can be optimally harnessed for **low-resource NLP** in high-impact fields such as biomedical and scientific research, medicine and law.

## Research Interests

Within the last decade, deep learning techniques from word embeddings to massive language models have enabled an explosion in our capacity to automate natural language processing (NLP) tasks and information extraction (IE) tasks in particular.  However, leveraging new NLP technologies often comes with high engineering and data costs, factors which make them risky to implement for many smaller institutions.

My research focuses on lowering the risks and costs of NLP systems to enable more parties to make thorough use of them. In particular, I am passionate about exploring how to best leverage modern **foundation models** to improve **data efficiency** and **generalizability** in NLP systems as well as how open-source knowledge resources like knowledge bases and taxonomies can make these systems more **interpretable** and **controllable**. I believe that improving NLP systems in these **4** directions (efficiency, generalizability, interpretability and controllability) will help meet the demands of high-impact areas like clinical practice, biomedical and scientific research, law and many others others. 

My current work is more narrowly focused on evaluating the incredible opportunities in generalizability and data efficiency that come with large language models like GPT-3 but also their risks and potentially surprising pitfalls primarly in the biomedical and clinical domains due to their high impact and complexity. I am excited to continue exploring these application fields throughout my PhD.

## Short Bio

I obtained my BA from UC Berkeley in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Probability Theory and a minor in Physics. After graduation, I was lucky enough to join [Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), a budding biomedical NLP startup, where I not only developed my technical and research skills but also saw first hand what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. After three years, I left Mendel to pursue my own research interests and joined the **Data, Knowledge and Intelligence Lab** led by Prof. Yu Su at The Ohio State University in Fall 2019. Last summer I completed a research internship in [Dr. Olivier Bodenreiderâ€™s](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/BodenreiderOlivier.html) lab at the National Library of Medicine working on making the process of maintaining the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) more efficient and higher quality.
