I'm a Computer Science PhD student at The Ohio State University. I feel very fortunate to be a part of the wonderful OSU NLP 
lab and have [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/) as my advisor.

## Research Interests

Over the last few years, my research has focused on leveraging and understanding **language models** of different 
sizes and domain-specificities for biomedical NLP tasks such as **information extraction** and **text classification**,
crucial pieces of impactful downstream applications such as organizing scientific literature, detecting 
dangerous drug-drug interactions or finding side-effects on social media which were previously unknown. 
This research has been driven by my passion for leveraging technology to help tackle impactful real-world problems which 
were previously impossible to solve. 
I am beyond excited to tackle the growing number of ready-to-solve problems that NLP has unlocked in a vast number of fields
from medicine and science to journalism, governance, education and more.

Beyond translational research, I am very interested in exploring how the apparent intelligence of LLMs emerges and
how it relates to human cognition. More specifically, I aim to investigate the interdependence of memorization and reasoning
in LLMs through retrieval-augmentation as well as methods from the knowledge-editing and probing literature. Given that our
intuition dictates that we can reason without memorization, I believe that exploring to what extent LLMs can do this as well
will lead to interesting insights for both improving LLMs and perhaps seeing our own brains a bit differently.

## Short Bio

I obtained my BA in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley where I also first encountered the wonders of backprop at 
the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). 
After graduation, in order to pursue my passion for solving impactful problems, I joined
[Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) 
and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), 
a biomedical NLP startup working to make clinical trial recruitment more effective and efficient. 
At Mendel, I not only developed my technical and research skills but also saw first hand 
what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. 

After three years, in the Fall of 2019, I left Mendel to join the OSU NLP lab and further develop my research skills. 
Most recently, in the summer of 2022, I completed a research internship in [Dr. Olivier Bodenreiderâ€™s](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/BodenreiderOlivier.html) 
lab at the National Library of Medicine working on improving the construction process of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

## Hobbies & Fun

In my free time, I like to stay active by going to the gym, dancing, playing soccer, climbing and hiking (preferably to 
and from tall mountains). I also love meeting interesting new people and learning about their lives (conferences are my 
happy place). When I am not moving around or socializing I like indulging in fun escapist content such as fantasy, 
sci-fi and even some magical realism from time to time.
