I'm a fifth year Computer Science PhD student at The Ohio State University. 
I feel very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/) and form part of the wonderful OSU NLP lab.

## Research Interests

My research interests are broadly centered around understanding and developing NLP technologies in knowledge-rich domains such as biomedicine. I am passionate about both **translational** research that works on solving impactful real-world problems as well as more **fundamental** research concerning the exciting new abilities of LLMs.

Over the last few years, my research has mainly focused on leveraging and understanding **language models** (of different 
sizes and pre-trained on different domains) to improve fundamental biomedical NLP tasks like **information extraction** as well as downstream tasks such as detecting dangerous drug-drug interactions and adverse events. I am beyond excited to continue tackling the growing number of ready-to-solve problems that the recent progress on NLP has unlocked in complex knowledge-rich domains.

On the other hand, I am intensely curious about exploring the extent of the interdependence that exists between memorization and reasoning in language models.  Human reasoning can be used regardless of context and well outside domains we have memorized, however, it is still unclear whether LLMs have similarly disentangled their reasoning capabilities from their more obvious semantic representation and memorization abilities. I believe addressing this question could lead to breakthroughs for improving LLMs for knowledge-rich domains and perhaps even understanding for our own brains a bit more deeply.

## Short Bio

I grew up in San José, Costa Rica and moved to the US in 2011 to obtain my BA in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley.
I first encountered the wonders of backprop while doing theoretical neuroscience research at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). 
After graduation I decided to pursue my passion for practical problems and joined
[Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) 
and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), 
a biomedical NLP startup working to make clinical trial recruitment for precision medicine more efficient.
At Mendel, I not only developed my technical and AI research skills but also saw first hand 
what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. 

I left Mendel three years later and started my PhD life at the OSU NLP lab. 
Most recently, in the summer of 2022, I completed a research internship in [Dr. Olivier Bodenreider’s](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/BodenreiderOlivier.html) 
lab at the National Library of Medicine working on improving the construction process of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

## Hobbies & Fun Times

In my free time, I like to stay active by going to the gym, dancing, playing soccer, climbing and hiking (preferably to 
and from tall mountains). I also love meeting interesting new people and learning about their lives and research (conferences are my 
happy place). When I am not moving around or socializing I like fun escapist content such as fantasy, 
sci-fi and some magical realism every once in a while.

Please send me an email or message me on Twitter if you wanna chat. Always down to meet new people!
