I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [Prof. Mark Dredze's](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/) lab at Johns Hopkins University. 

I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science & Engineering at The Ohio State University, under the guidance of [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/) and the entire OSU NLP Group.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the intersection between **biology** and **AI**. 

[**AI** &rarr; **Biology**] I am passionate about how AI systems can have a direct effect on people's lives by improving both biomedical research and clinical practice. 

[**Biology** &rarr; **AI**]  I am deeply inspired by neurobiology and believe that borrowing insights from the human brain will be key to building even more powerful AI systems that can continuously integrate new knowledge about the world and reason robustly over it just like we do.

## News

<b>9/2025:</b> Started my postdoc at Johns Hopkins with Prof. Mark Dredze. Excited for this new chapter!

<b>8/2025:</b> Thanks to my advisor, my committee, my OSU NLP and my lovely friends and family, I was able to earn my PhD from the Ohio State University!!

<b>6/2025:</b> Happy to be part of OSU NLP's effort to evaluate LLM agents on real world long-horizon agentic tasks: ["Mind2Web 2: Evaluating Agentic Search with Agent-as-a-Judge"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21506).

<b>5/2024:</b> HippoRAG 2 was accepted to ICML 2025!

<b>2/2025:</b> We released the paper and code for our new version of HippoRAG. The paper ["From RAG to Memory: Non-Parametric Continual Learning for
Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14802), shows that our newest iteration outperforms other graph-augmented RAG solutions as well as the strongest standard RAG systems currently available.

<b>1/2025:</b> Became a PhD candidate after my thesis proposal "AI for Biology & Biology for AI: Exploring the Symbiosis Between AI Systems and Biomedical Research" was accepted.

<b>1/2025:</b> Our paper ["Attention in Large Language Models Yields Efficient Zero-Shot Re-Rankers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02642), which explores how LLM attention can be used to improve re-ranking was accepted to ICLR 2025.

<b>9/2024:</b> HippoRAG was accepted to NeurIPS 2024!

<b>5/2024:</b> We released ["HippoRAG: Neurobiologically Inspired Long-Term Memory for Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831), a novel RAG framework inspired by human long-term memory that enables LLMs to continuously integrate knowledge across external documents.

<b>10/2023:</b> Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15106.pdf) examining the importance of problem formulation for real-world problems through the task of UMLS Vocabulary Insertion was accepted to EMNLP 2023 (Findings).

<b>6/2023:</b> Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17649.pdf) exploring whether the sub-optimal segmentation performance of standard biomedical tokenizers has an effect on downstream LM performance was accepted to the BioNLP Workshop @ ACL 2023.<br>

<b>5/2023:</b> Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.11159.pdf) unlocking the hidden relation extraction abilities of LLMs by aligning RE with question answering was accepted to ACL 2023 (Findings).<br>

<b>10/2022:</b> Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08410.pdf) discussing potential limitations of GPT-3 in-context learning for biomedical IE was accepted to EMNLP 2022 (Findings). <br>

<b>5/2022:</b> Joined Dr. Bodenreider's lab at the National Library of Medicine for a summer internship. <br>

<b>3/2021:</b> Won an Accelerator Grant from the Translational Data Analytics Institute for Social Media Pharmacovigilance. <br>

<b>10/2020:</b> Our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.332/) introducing a text classification dataset regarding COVID-19 documents was accepted to EMNLP 2020 (Findings). <br>

<b>4/2020:</b> Our [paper]( http://aclanthology.lst.uni-saarland.de/2020.acl-main.410.pdf) conducting a comprehensive study on the Clinical Reading Comprehension task based on the emrQA dataset was accepted to ACL 2020. <br>

## Short Bio

I grew up in San José, Costa Rica and moved to the US in 2011 to obtain my BA in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley.
I first encountered the wonders of backprop while doing theoretical neuroscience research at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). 
After graduation I decided to pursue my passion for practical problems and joined
[Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) 
and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), 
a biomedical NLP startup working to make clinical trial recruitment for precision medicine more efficient.
At Mendel, I not only developed my technical and AI research skills but also saw first hand 
what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. 

I left Mendel three years later and started my PhD life at the OSU NLP lab. 
Most recently, in the summer of 2022, I completed a research internship in [Dr. Olivier Bodenreider’s](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/BodenreiderOlivier.html) 
lab at the National Library of Medicine working on improving the construction process of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

## Hobbies & Fun Times

In my free time, I like to stay active by dancing, playing soccer, climbing and hiking (preferably to 
and from tall mountains). I also love meeting interesting new people and learning about their lives and research (conferences are my 
happy place).

Please send me an email or message me on Twitter if you wanna chat. Always down to meet new people!
