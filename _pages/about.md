Hi! My name is Bernal Jiménez, I'm a Computer Science PhD student at The Ohio State University working with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). My research focuses on natural language processing with an emphasis on **low-resource biomedical information extraction**. I obtained my BA in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Probability Theory and a minor in Physics from UC Berkeley. 

After graduation, I was lucky enough to join [Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), a budding biomedical NLP startup, where I not only developed my technical and research skills but also saw first hand what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. After three years I left Mendel to pursue my own research interests and joined the **Data, Knowledge and Intelligence Lab** led by Prof. Yu Su at The Ohio State University in Fall 2019. During Summer 2022, I completed a research internship in [Dr. Olivier Bodenreider’s](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/BodenreiderOlivier.html) lab at the National Library of Medicine where I worked on improving the real-world applicability of deep learning models for the management of the United Medical Language System, one of the largest open source medical knowledge bases. More information can be found in my [CV (Nov 2022)](https://bernaljg.github.io/files/Bernal_Jimenez_CV%20(1).pdf).

## Research Interests

Within the last decade, deep learning techniques from word embeddings to massive language models have enabled an explosion in our capacity to automate natural language processing (NLP) and information extraction (IE) tasks. This has led to many new opportunities to provide knowledge workers with relevant information reliably and automatically, vastly improving their efficiency and accuracy. However, opportunities in IE technologies often come with large risks as well as high engineering and data costs, factors which put them out of reach for many institutions.

My research focuses on lowering the risks and costs of information extraction systems so that more parties came make thorough use of them. In particular, I am passionate about exploring how to best leverage **foundation models** to improve **data efficiency** and **generalizability** in IE systems as well as how open-source knowledge resources like knowledge bases and taxonomies can make these systems more **interpretable** and **controllable**. 

I hope that working on improving IE systems in these **4** directions (efficiency, generalizability, interpretability and controllability) will help meet the demands of high-impact areas like clinical practice, biomedical research, law, journalism and others. Due to their high impact and complexity, my current work is more narrowly focused on the biomedical and clinical domains and I am excited to continue exploring these fields throughout my PhD as well as branch out to other domains in the future.
