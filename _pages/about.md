## Short Bio

Hi! My name is Bernal Jim√©nez, I'm a Computer Science PhD student at The Ohio State University working with [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). My research focuses on natural language processing with an emphasis on **foundation models** applications for **efficient biomedical information extraction**. I obtained my BA in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Probability Theory and a minor in Physics from UC Berkeley. After graduation, I was lucky enough to join [Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), a budding biomedical NLP startup, where I developed not only my technical and research skills but also saw first hand what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. After three years I left Mendel to pursue my own research interests and joined the **Data, Knowledge and Intelligence Lab** led by Prof. Yu Su at The Ohio State University in Fall 2019. During Summer 

## Research Interests

I am passionate about leveraging modern NLP methods and curated knowledge resources to build more efficient, interpretable and controllable IE systems which meet the needs of high-impact areas like clinical practice, biomedical research and law.
