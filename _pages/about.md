I'm in the final year of my PhD in Computer Science & Engineering at The Ohio State University. 
I feel very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/) and form part of the wonderful OSU NLP lab.

Currently looking for Fall 2025 opportunities! 

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the intersection between **biology** and **AI**. On the one hand, I am passionate about how AI systems can accelerate biomedical research and directly improve people's lives. On the other hand, neurobiology is extremely inspiring to me and I strongly believe that human brain insights will help us overcome some of the current limitations in AI systems such as failures in reasoning, knowledge retrieval and continual learning.

My (**AI** -> **Biology**) research has focused on understanding how to best leverage **LLMs** for a wide variety of biomedical NLP tasks such as **document classification**, **information extraction** and **knowledge base construction**.

My (**Biology** -> **AI**) research focuses on understanding brain mechanisms in a more abstract way that can inspire useful and novel ways of thinking about current AI limitations.  [HippoRAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831) is a wonderful example which leverages a well-established theory of human long-term memory to inspire a simple, efficient and powerful retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.

## News

## Short Bio

I grew up in San José, Costa Rica and moved to the US in 2011 to obtain my BA in Applied Mathematics from UC Berkeley.
I first encountered the wonders of backprop while doing theoretical neuroscience research at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). 
After graduation I decided to pursue my passion for practical problems and joined
[Dr. Karim Galil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karim-galil-m-d-83a2b258/) 
and [Dr. Wael Salloum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waelsalloum/) at [Mendel AI](https://www.mendel.ai/), 
a biomedical NLP startup working to make clinical trial recruitment for precision medicine more efficient.
At Mendel, I not only developed my technical and AI research skills but also saw first hand 
what it takes to build a successful company from the ground up. 

I left Mendel three years later and started my PhD life at the OSU NLP lab. 
Most recently, in the summer of 2022, I completed a research internship in [Dr. Olivier Bodenreider’s](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/researchstaff/BodenreiderOlivier.html) 
lab at the National Library of Medicine working on improving the construction process of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).

## Hobbies & Fun Times

In my free time, I like to stay active by dancing, playing soccer, climbing and hiking (preferably to 
and from tall mountains). I also love meeting interesting new people and learning about their lives and research (conferences are my 
happy place).

Please send me an email or message me on Twitter if you wanna chat. Always down to meet new people!
